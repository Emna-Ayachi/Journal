Tawakkul Journal Website
Welcome to the Tawakkul Journal website! This project is my first attempt at building a website from scratch, created to help me learn and practice CSS. The site features an imaginary journal called Tawakkul, inspired by the Arabic word تَوَكُّل (Tawakkul), which signifies trust and reliance on the divine plan while striving for personal growth and peace.
